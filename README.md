# The-Random-Guess
The system generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
If the player guess is higher than the actual number, it asks the user to enter the lower number.
similarly, if the player guess is too low, it asks user to enter the higher number.
When the user guess the correct number it displays the number of the guesses, the player
used to arrive at a number.
If the user has guessed the number in the lesser attempts then it will create a new highscore which will be
updated in the highscore.txt file
