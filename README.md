# The-Random-Guess
The system generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.
If the player guess is higher than the actual number, it displays "Lower Number Please".
similarly, if the player guess is too low, it displayes "Higher Number Please".
When the user guess the correct number it displays the number of the guesses, the player
used to arrive at a number.
